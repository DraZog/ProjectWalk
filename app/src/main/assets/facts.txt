Flowing water creates energy that can be captured and turned into electricity.This is called hydroelectric power or hydropower.
It is a fuel created immediately from living matter. This means it doesn't use fossil fuels that are scarce!
Wind energy is extracted from airflow using wind turbines to produce mechanical or electrical energy.
Is radiant light and heat from the Sun harnessed using a range of evolving technologies such as solar cells.
Is energy derived from the internal heat of the Earth. A natural example of this is natural occurring hot springs.
